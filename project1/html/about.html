    Prov 29:18 - But without vision, the people cast off restraint.  If a person does not see what their purpose is, and the hope that is before them, then they are bound to reject the role associated, and pursue other purpose, and this to their own destruction.

    Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us…
    Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

    Hand me the coin…whose inscription is on it? (What is Jesus thinking at this moment?)
    Give to Caesar what belongs to Caeser.
    Give to God what belongs to God.

    This is an image discussion.  The coin had Caesers image.
    We are made in the image of God.
