      “De Soya knew that both assumptions were almost certainly true.

    <h3>Reviewing his new ship</h3>
    <p>
      Before the cruiser blacked into oblivion, de Soya noticed how the fusion
      drive spheres had been clustered like pearls around the central ship’s
      axis rather than concentrated in a single swelling such as on his old
      torchship, the Balthasar. He also noticed how much smaller the hexagonal
      Gideon-drive array was on this ship than on the prototype Raphael. His
      last glimpse before the ship became invisible was of the lights glowing
      from the retracted, translucent living cubbies and the clear dome of
      the command deck.”

            “During combat, de Soya knew from his reading on Pacem and the
            RNA-instructional injections he had received at Pax Fleet headquarters that
            these clear areas would morph thicker, armored epidermises, but de Soya
            had always enjoyed a view and would appreciate the window into space.

            “Coming up on the Uriel, sir,” said the midshipman pilot.
        </p>
        <p>
            De Soya nodded. The H.H.S. Uriel seemed a near-clone of the new Raphael, but as the wasp-shuttle decelerated closer, the father-captain could pick out the extra omega-knife generators, the added, glowing conference cubbies, and the more elaborate com antennae that made this vessel the flagship of the task force.”
