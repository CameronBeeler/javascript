        <h3 class="review">Reviewing his new ship</h3>
        <p class="cruiser">
            Before the cruiser blacked into oblivion, de Soya noticed how the
            fusion
            drive spheres had been clustered like pearls around the central
            ship’s
            axis rather than concentrated in a single swelling such as on his
            old
            torchship, the Balthasar. He also noticed how much smaller the
            hexagonal
            Gideon-drive array was on this ship than on the prototype Raphael.
            His
            last glimpse before the ship became invisible was of the lights
            glowing
            from the retracted, translucent living cubbies and the clear dome of
            the command deck.”

            <h4>RNA instructional injections</h4>

                “During combat, de Soya knew from his reading on Pacem and the
                RNA-instructional injections he had received at Pax Fleet
                headquarters that
                these clear areas would morph thicker, armored epidermises, but
                de Soya
                had always enjoyed a view and would appreciate the window into
                space.

                “Coming up on the Uriel, sir,” said the midshipman pilot.
            </p>
            <p class="cruiser secondclass">
                De Soya nodded. The H.H.S. Uriel seemed a near-clone of the new
                Raphael, but as the wasp-shuttle decelerated closer, the
                father-captain could pick out the extra omega-knife generators,
                the added, glowing conference cubbies, and the more elaborate
                com antennae that made this vessel the flagship of the task
                force.”
